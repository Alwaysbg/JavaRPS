# JavaRPS
Classic console based game with Java Ant

#How to Play
The computer randomly selects either Stone, Paper, or Scissors.

The user is prompted to enter their choice:

Enter 0 for Stone.
Enter 1 for Paper.
Enter 2 for Scissors.
The program compares the user's choice to the computer's choice and determines the winner based on the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors rules:

Stone crushes Scissors (Stone wins).
Scissors cut Paper (Scissors wins).
Paper covers Stone (Paper wins).
The result of the game (win, lose, or draw) is displayed on the console.
